My motovation in creating this website is to create a list of the workers for a company and display the manager on the top. The cards will show the workers rank, name, ID email and contact more.
This works though the terminal, one would simply enter 'node index.js' and fill out the form. first the managers name, id, email,, and office number followed by a list of options

A good use for this application would be to display all the workers on on screen with their information
